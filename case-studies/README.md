## Case studies

This directory contains three case studies that mirror the
three research questions in [the paper](http://memsynth.uwplse.org/memsynth-pldi17.pdf)'s main evaluation:

* Can MemSynth scale to real-world memory models such as PowerPC and x86?<br>
  ([`synthesis`](synthesis))
* Does MemSynth provide a basis for rapidly building useful automated memory model tools?<br>
  ([`repair`](repair))
* Does MemSynth outperform existing relational solvers and memory model tools?<br>
  ([`performance`](performance))
